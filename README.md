# üåê 42 Common Core - my journey at 42 Lisboa

Hello! I'm Daan, and this is my repository documenting my experiences and learning at 42 Lisboa's Common Core program.

## üëã Introduction

Welcome to my journey through the innovative and challenging world of coding at 42 Lisboa. This README is where I'll be sharing insights, projects, and progress as I delve into software development.

## üìö About 42 Lisboa's Common Core

The Common Core at 42 is a unique learning adventure. Here's what it involves:

- **Peer-to-Peer Learning:** No traditional lectures here - it's all about collaborating and learning from fellow students.
- **Project-Based Approach:** Hands-on projects that cover a range of topics from basic algorithms to complex systems.
- **Diverse Technologies:** Starting with C and expanding into various programming languages and tools.
- **Developing Soft Skills:** Emphasizing critical thinking, teamwork, and problem-solving.

## üíº My Projects

Here's a snapshot of what I've been working on:

- **[Libft](https://github.com/daanmlab/libft):** Building my own C library, a foundational project to understand basic C programming.
- **[Ft_Printf](https://github.com/daanmlab/ft_printf):** Recreating the famous printf function in C to learn variadic functions.
- **[Get_Next_Line](https://github.com/daanmlab/get_next_line):** A function to read content line by line from a file descriptor.
- **[Push_Swap](https://github.com/daanmlab/push_swap):** Solving a sorting algorithm problem with a predefined set of operations.
- **[Minitalk](https://github.com/daanmlab/minitalk):** Implementing a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.
- **[So_Long](https://github.com/daanmlab/so_long):** Developing a 2D game, focusing on graphical elements and player interaction.
- **[Philosophers](https://github.com/daanmlab/philosophers):** Exploring threads and processes, simulating the dining philosopher problem.
- **[Minishell](https://github.com/daanmlab/minishell):** Creating a simple shell to understand process creation and synchronisation.

## üéØ Goals

My objectives in this program are:

- Gaining a deep understanding of programming fundamentals.
- Collaborating on exciting projects with my peers.
- Building a diverse portfolio of work.
- Preparing for advanced specialization after the Common Core.

## üîî Stay Updated

I'll be regularly updating this repository with my latest work and experiences. Stay tuned!

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy following my journey at 42 Lisboa!
